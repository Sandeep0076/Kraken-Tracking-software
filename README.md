The desktop application (Kraken.me Desktop) is a C# Windows application that tracks user activity data and document content which are later used as the input for the activity
detection and mapping algorithm.
Tracking, storing and sending data to the Kraken.me Server is done in background full automatically, so  no user interaction is needed.

This platform aggregates and stores different sensor data from different sources like mobile devices and the desktop using a simple app that traces the users behavior and collects which resources are accessed by the user. It delivers information like which app is currently running, what user interface objects are clicked and what websites and documents are visited or edited by the user. All collected information is stored and aggregated on a secure server. Based on this platform, we will see how the system is integrated and designed, as well as how good the system performs on real user data.
